This project is developing as an example of general settings to blog web site. As a backend I used WordPress CMS and React library Gatsby as frontend.

Here is the link to [figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/cwWOI0Xowb370hqfFeto7h/The-Blog---A-Web-Personal-Blog-(Community)?type=design&mode=design&t=XRC3uM1OgNKv5qlC-0)

I want to implement different features like:

1. filters for blog
2. pagination
3. posts slider with separating data

Feel free to contact me if you have idea to make something better.
